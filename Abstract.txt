Abstract
Due to the recent growth of available online data on customers and clients as well as social tagging becoming popular, 
tag-aware recommender systems are attracting more attention increasingly. The advancements on the incorporation of customer 
review for developing recommender systems are scarce and those few available studies have only used meta-data available out 
of the reviews without any analysis of the reviews itself. Moreover, deep neural networks as a methodology for recommender 
\systems is recently being considered and recommendation systems are being developed using AI. As deep learning has 
demonstrated its value in various areas of data intelligence. In this project, using real-case large-size datasets from 
Amazon, a dictionary of related tags is extracted and developed for each category of the products. Then, I modify this 
dictionary based on the reviews available in the dataset and then will incorporate them as a new feature to develop the 
recommender system. The idea is that when a user is commenting about a feature, it means that feature is important to the 
customer and should be considered as a more important feature. In addition, a deep neural network for this recommender system 
will be developed to provide effective and efficient recommendations. This deep neural network will work as an autoencoder to 
extract deep features which take the place of item-tag matrix and constructs item-deep feature matrix to be used in the 
recommendation system. I believe the use of deep neural networks helps in overcoming the problem of sparsity, ambiguity, 
redundancy along with the ability to provide new exciting items to customers and ultimately, increase the sale and profit for 
the e-commerce company.
